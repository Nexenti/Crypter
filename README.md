# Crypter
c# crypter, example how to encrypt a application and insert it into a stub(another application wich launch the other program).
The stub will (on launch) get the byte's of the application and insert it into memory.
Because the application is encrypted, only the source code of the stub can be decompiled.
This way you can create safe licenses ~and hide applications from antivirus~.

```diff
- I am not responsible for any damage.
- It is not my intention to let you hide applications from antivirus.
- This is for learning purposes only.
